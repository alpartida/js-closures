# js-closures

This code is a challenge from my SheCodes Workshop. After every lesson, there are small challenges to complete and this one was about JS Closures. 
I implemented a function within a function in relation to converting temperature from celsius to fahrenheit. This code was a huge help in creating my final project, a Weather App.
